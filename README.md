# Group_Project_3_Digiset
 
A collaborative group effort during our time at UofT SCS UX/UI Bootcamp. Digiset is an app designed
to view and track all forms of digital assets with the full scope of the project hoping to be 
expanded to physical assets with the use of robust API's. We had a 3-week timeline for this project.
The intended delieverables were a high fidelity prototype, research to show how we got there, and a
promotional website. We do hope to one day develop this app into a functioning web application but
the team does not currently possess any back end technologies.
